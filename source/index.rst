Kafka 101 Documentation
=======================

This documentation accompanies the
`Kafka 101 github project <https://github.com/davecharles/kafka_demo>`_.
It provides a step-by-step guide to:

- Clone the Kafka 101 Github repository.
- Using Docker Compose, spin up a local single node Kafka cluster.
- Build a simple kafka producer and consumer for a simple "Weather Data" app.
- Embark on an exciting journey toward commanding all things Kafka!

Using this guide
----------------

Begin with the `Getting Started <docs/001-Getting-Started.html>`_ section where
you'll get a bit of background, understand the prerequisites working with
the Kafka 101 repo and start up a local Kafka.

Work through the next two sections;
`Writing a Producer <docs/002-Writing-a-Producer.html>`_ and
`Writing a Consumer <docs/003-Writing-a-Consumer.html>`_.

Finally, take a look at `Next Steps <docs/004-Next-Steps.html>`_ to see what
further topics should be covered.
